    <p>
      Keyboard typing is the skill of typing using a keyboard, either mechanical or digital, without
      the need to look at the keys. For someone who has never typed before, it might seem
      challenging, but with dedication and practice, it becomes an essential skill for modern
      living. Here's a guide to help beginners get started:
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-1">Understanding the Keyboard</h4>
    <p>
      Before diving into the act of typing, it's crucial to get a good grasp of the keyboard layout.
      Most keyboards follow the QWERTY format, named after the first six letters in the top row.
      However, layouts like AZERTY or DVORAK might also be encountered. Familiarizing oneself with
      the layout helps in achieving typing fluency faster.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-2 mb-1">The Importance of Proper Posture</h4>
    <p>
      While it might seem unrelated, the way you sit plays a significant role in how effectively you
      type. Maintain a straight back and ensure both feet are flat on the ground. Your chair and
      keyboard should be adjusted so that your elbows remain close to your body, forming an angle
      between 90 and 110 degrees. Proper posture not only boosts typing efficiency but also ensures
      you remain comfortable and avoid strain.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-2 mb-1">Mastering the Home Row</h4>
    <p>
      The home row is essentially your typing anchor. This row of keys is where your fingers
      naturally rest and return to after typing other keys. For the left hand, the home row keys are
      A, S, D, and F, and for the right hand, they're J, K, L, and ;. The raised bumps on the F and
      J keys are there to help you align your fingers without looking.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-2 mb-1">The Journey to Touch Typing</h4>
    <p>
      Touch typing is the ability to type without having to glance at the keyboard. It might be
      tempting to peek, especially when starting, but the goal is to rely on muscle memory. If
      mistakes happen, and they will, try to correct them by feel rather than sight. With time and
      practice, the need to look will diminish.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-2 mb-1">Accuracy Over Speed</h4>
    <p>
      For beginners, the focus should always be on accuracy. Speed comes naturally with time and
      consistent practice. Initially, it's more beneficial to type correctly than quickly. Over
      time, as muscle memory develops, both speed and precision will improve.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-2 mb-1">Regular Practice is Key</h4>
    <p>
      Like any skill, regular practice is the cornerstone of mastery. Dedicate a set amount of time
      daily or several times a week to practice typing. There are various online tools and software
      designed to help beginners hone their skills.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg mt-2 mb-1">Caring for Your Hands</h4>
    <p>
      Typing can be taxing on the hands and wrists. Ensure you take short breaks, especially during
      prolonged typing sessions. Stretching your fingers, hands, and wrists can help alleviate any
      tension or discomfort.
    </p>

    <p>
      By embracing these concepts and dedicating time to practice, anyone can become proficient in
      keyboard typing. It's a journey of patience, consistency, and continuous learning.
